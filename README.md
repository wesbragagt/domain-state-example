# Domain State Example

Implementing exercises from enterprise architecture patterns from Front End Masters.

In this repo I exercise the use of typed state within a simple react app.

The flow is the follow

1. Create a client interface. 
2. Create a state interface.
3. Create the initial state by attaching the contract of the state interface.
